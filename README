About
-----

SRVMON is a simple monitoring suite for servers, switches, routers and
every other device which has network access. SRVMON uses a SQL database,
where it stores the hosts which should be checked. A user can define
multiple status checks which can then applied to a host. A user group 
can be notified via E-Mail if there is any change in status of a host.

The suite is divided into multiple parts.

Database
--------

The first and most important part is the database. The database has been
created in MariaDB but should also work with MySQL. It should also be 
possible to use MSSQL. The database also offers multiple stored routines
which can be used to control the data of the database.

Director
--------

The next part is the SRVMON director. This program is only used to check
if the hosts, which are defined in the database, are reachable. The
director disables a host and all its children if the communication
fails. The director is written in Java.
* A director Shell script is available for testing (director-bash.sh)

Agent
-----

The next part is the SRVMON agent component. The SRVMON agent is used on
the clients in order to communicate with the database and also used to
execute the check commands on the host. The agent can execute multiple
check commands which can be defined in the database. A service could be
a simple shell script which checks the CPU usage. The agent would then
periodically execute the script and send the output to the SQL database.
The agent is written in Java.
* An agent Shell script is available for testing (agent-bash.sh)

Web UI
------

Another part of SRVMON is the Web UI. The webinterface can be used to 
view and configure the SRVMON suite. The webinterface has been written 
in PHP5 and JQuery/Javascript and also uses Boostrap.

Desktop Client
--------------

The last part is the desktop client, which is essentially the same as
the webinterface only that it is a standalone application. I created the
application only to show you that it is possible to create multiple user
interfaces for this suite because all the main logic happens in the
database. The Desktop Client is written in Java for easy porting.
* Not yet decided if I use C++ or Java...

Why?
----

I created this monitoring suite just for fun and I know that there are 
other monitoring solutions available but I wanted to do my own project. 
The goal of this project is to create a completely customizable 
monitoring solution. Please feel free to modify and improve this suite.

For any questions please send a mail to <pwarnimo(at)gmail.com>.

Requirements
------------

Webserver requirements:
 Apache 2
 MariaDB (or MySQL)
 PHP5
 PHP-GD
 PHP-FPDF
 PHP-MCRYPT
 
As operating system for the webinterface and director, I used Debian 7.8
Wheezy.

The agents can run on Unix,Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems.
(It should be possible to port it on other, more exotic systems...)

The agents should run on every system which supports Java and the SQL
connector for Java. The service scripts that I use are simple shell
scripts.

NOTE: You are not required to use the agent component. It is also 
      possible to write an own agent in a shell script as long as it
      supports a connection to the database. The only thing that the
      agent does, is scheduling the service checks and executing the
      stored procedures in the database.
