SRVMON DATABASE - INSTALLATION GUIDE
====================================

(This guide is used for the Debian package)

* Prerequisites *

Before you begin please perform a system update of your installation to
make sure that you have the newest packages installed:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Please install a compatible SQL server on your machine you can either
use MariaDB or MySQL. The following version of MariaDB has been used
for this project:

	Name                  Version         Architecture
	=====================-===============-===============
	mariadb-server        10.0.16-1       all

* Installation *

Load the database into the server by using the following commands:

	cd <Database project directory>
	mysql -uroot -p
	<Type your password next>
	CREATE DATABASE <srvmon>
	SOURCE sql/db/srvmon-1.0.1.sql
	SOURCE sql/dump/init.sql

We now need to add an user which has access to the database. Still
inside the SQL client input the following commands:

	CREATE USER '<Your DB username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Your PW';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON srvmon . * TO '<Your DB User>'@'localhost';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	EXIT

The database is now installed and initialized. The next step you need
to perform is to load the stored routines into the database. A script
has been provided for this. Before you can use the script you have to
configure the database username and password inside the script:

	cd <Database project directory>
	vim tools/loadroutines.sh

Inside that file, find the following section and edit to your needs:

	...
	SQLUSR="<DB username>"
	SQLPW="<DB user password>"
	...

Simply execute the script with the following commands:

	cd <Database project directory>
	tools/loadroutines.sh

You can test the database by querying the settings table:

	CALL getDBVersion(@err);

If the command above returns the DB version, everything has worked.

* Etc *
