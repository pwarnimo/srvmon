DlgFirstStart.jTextArea1.text=About\n-----\n\nSRVMON is a simple monitoring suite for servers, switches, routers and\nevery other device which has network access. SRVMON uses a SQL database,\nwhere it stores the hosts which should be checked. A user can define\nmultiple status checks which can then applied to a host. A user group \ncan be notified via E-Mail if there is any change in status of a host.\n\nThe suite is divided into multiple parts.\n\nDatabase (<basedir>/database)\n--------\n\nThe first and most important part is the database. The database has been\ncreated in MariaDB but should also work with MySQL. It should also be \npossible to use MSSQL. The database also offers multiple stored routines\nwhich can be used to control the data of the database.\n\nDirector (<basedir>/director)\n--------\n\nThe next part is the SRVMON director. The directory also has 2 parts.\nThe first part is the UPDATER which runs on the database server. The\nUPDATER then fetches a list of the available hosts from the database and\nchecks if the hosts are reachable. The second part of the director is\nthe SERVER, which is used to receive the XML data from the AGENTS.\nThe UPDATER is written in Java and the SERVER is written in PHP.\n* A director Shell script is available for testing (director-bash.sh).\n* An updater written in C is planned (Just because I can :-)).\n\nAgent (<basedir>/agent)\n-----\n\nThe next part is the SRVMON agent component. The SRVMON agent is used on\nthe clients in order to communicate with the database and also used to\nexecute the check commands on the host. The agent can execute multiple\ncheck commands which can be defined in the database. A service could be\na simple shell script which checks the CPU usage. The agent would then\nperiodically execute the script and send the output to the DIRECTOR\nserver using XML data. The agent is written in Java.\n* An agent Shell script is available for testing (agent-bash.sh)\n* An agent written in C is planned (Just because I can :-)).\n\nWeb UI (<basedir>/webclient)\n------\n\nAnother part of SRVMON is the Web UI. The webinterface can be used to \nview and configure the SRVMON suite. The webinterface has been written \nin PHP5 and JQuery/Javascript and also uses Boostrap.\n\nDesktop Client (<basedir>/desktopclient)\n--------------\n\nThe last part is the desktop client, which is essentially the same as\nthe webinterface only that it is a standalone application. I created the\napplication only to show you that it is possible to create multiple user\ninterfaces for this suite because all the main logic happens in the\ndatabase. The Desktop Client is written in Java for easy porting.\n* Not yet decided if I use C++ w/ QT or Java...\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nI created this monitoring suite just for fun and I know that there are \nother monitoring solutions available but I wanted to do my own project. \nThe goal of this project is to create a completely customizable \nmonitoring solution. Please feel free to modify and improve this suite.\n\nI also set to my goal, that I want to get this package into the official\nDebian repositories so that everyone can get, work and share this \nproject.\n\nFor any questions please send a mail to <pwarnimo(at)gmail.com>.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nWebserver requirements:\n Apache 2\n MariaDB (or MySQL)\n PHP5\n PHP-GD (Not yet used)\n PHP-FPDF (Not yet used)\n PHP-MCRYPT\n \nAs operating system for the webinterface, director and agents, I used\nthe following:\n\n\t* Debian 7.8 Wheezy\n\t* Debian 8.0 Wheezy\n\t* CentOS 6.0\n\t* Arch Linux\n\nFor the development of the project, I used Debian 7.8 & 8.0. The code\nhas been mostly created with vim. For the Java updater and agents I\nused Eclipse 3.8.1.\n\nSome more informations of the Development System are below:\n\n\tName                  Version         Architecture \n\t=====================-===============-===============\n\tmariadb-server        10.0.16-1       all\n\tapache2               2.4.10-10       amd64          \n\tphp5                  5.6.7+dfsg-1    all\n\tphp5-mysql            5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64\n\tphp5-mcrypt           5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64\n\tphp5-gd               5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64\n\tphp-fpdf              3:1.7.dfsg-1    all\n\topenjdk-7-jdk:amd64   7u79-2.5.5-1~de amd64\n\tant                   1.9.4-3         all\n\nAs for now, the installation guides only apply for Debian, but I plan\nto create guides for the other OSes as well.\n\nThe agents can run on Unix,Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems.\n(It should be possible to port it on other, more exotic systems...)\n* Windows support is currently non-existent but planned... :-)\n\nThe agents should run on every system which supports Java and the SQL\nconnector for Java. The service scripts that I use are simple shell\nscripts.\n\nNOTE: You are not required to use the agent component. It is also \n      possible to write an own agent in a shell script as long as it\n      supports a connection to the database. The only thing that the\n      agent does, is scheduling the service checks and executing the\n      stored procedures in the database.
