SRVMON DIRECTOR - SERVER V1.0 R1 - INSTALLATION GUIDE
=====================================================

(This guide is used for the Debian package)

* Prerequisites *

Before you begin please perform a system update of your installation to
make sure that you have the newest packages installed:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Please make sure that you have the following packages installed on your 
system:

	Name                  Version         Architecture
	=====================-===============-===============
	apache2               2.4.10-10       amd64
	php5                  5.6.7+dfsg-1    all
	php5-mysql            5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64

It is also important that the SRVMON database is installed and 
initialized on the system. If not please refer to the installation
manual for the database.

If you want to generate the documentation for the source code, you will
need to install the phpDocumentor. This can be easily done with 
PHP-PEAR:
	
	pear channel-discover pear.phpdoc.org
	pear install phpdoc/phpDocumentor

To generate the documentation use the following command:

	phpdoc -d src/ -t doc

The documentation will be created into the doc folder.

* Installation *

 ** Automatic setup

If you want to automatically setup the DIRECTOR SERVER, you only have
to execute the setup.sh script in the project directory. Please make
sure that you have the appropriate user rights and that the 
destination web root is writable for your user. You could also
execute the script as root, but this is not advised. Please follow
the onscreen instructions until the setup has finished.

 ** Manual setup

Simply copy all the files from the project directory to your webserver
root:

	Ex.: rsync -azP src/ /var/www/vhost/srvmon/

After the files have been copied to your web root, you then have to
modify the init.php file according to your database configuration:

	vim <webroot>/inc/init.php

Find the section below and modify it to your needs:
	
	...
	$GLOBALS["config"] = array(
		"mysql" => array(
			"host"   => "<IP of DB server>",
			"user"   => "<DB username>",
			"pass"   => "<DB user password>",
			"dbname" => "<DB name>"
		)
	);
	...

I will not go into detail on how to configure a virtual host on
Apache2. If you want to do this, please consult the documentation for
Apache2.

If everything has been installed correctly, the web application will 
display the following text when you visit the url:

	SRVMON DIRECTOR - SEVER 1.0 R1

	Waiting for input . . .

Please note that the current agents do not support HTTPS connections.
