SRVMON DIRECTOR SERVER V1.1 P1 - INSTALLATION GUIDE
===================================================

* Introduction *

This guide will help you to setup the SRVMON Director Server on your 
computer. Please note that this guide is intended for the Debian
release.

* Prerequisites *

Before you begin please perform a system update of your installation to
make sure that you have the newest packages installed:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Please make sure that you have the following packages installed on your 
system:

	Name                  Version         Architecture
	=====================-===============-===============
	apache2               2.4.10-10       amd64
	php5                  5.6.7+dfsg-1    all
	php5-mysql            5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64

It is also important that the SRVMON database is installed and 
initialized on the system. If not please refer to the installation
manual for the database.

If you want to generate the documentation for the source code, you will
need to install the phpDocumentor. This can be easily done with 
PHP-PEAR:
	
	pear channel-discover pear.phpdoc.org
	pear install phpdoc/phpDocumentor

To generate the documentation use the following command:

	phpdoc -d src/ -t doc

The documentation will be created into the doc folder.

* Installation *

 ** Install from repostitories

The easiest way to install the server is by using the repositories for
the SRVMON project. Please import the GPG key for the repositories by
using the commands below as root:

	wget -O - http://debian.scrubstudios.de/apt/conf/scrubstudios.gpg.key|apt-key add -

After the key has been imported, you can now add the repository by
creating a new file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ called "srvmon.list".
Insert the following string inside the file:

If using Debian 7.x Wheezy :
	deb http://debian.scrubstudios.de/apt/debian wheezy main

If using Debian 8.x Jessie :
	deb http://debian.scrubstudios.de/apt/debian wheezy main

You now have to refresh the package lists and then you can install
the server with the following commands:

	apt-get update
	apt-get install srvmon-director-server

After the package has been installed, the automatic setup script will
launch.

 ** Automatic setup

If you want to automatically setup the DIRECTOR SERVER, you only have
to execute the setup.sh script in the project directory. Please make
sure that you have the appropriate user rights and that the 
destination web root is writable for your user. You could also
execute the script as root, but this is not advised. Please follow
the onscreen instructions until the setup has finished.

 ** Manual setup

Simply copy all the files from the project directory to your webserver
root:

	Ex.: rsync -azP src/ /var/www/vhost/srvmon/

After the files have been copied to your web root, you then have to
modify the init.php file according to your database configuration:

	vim <webroot>/inc/init.php

Find the section below and modify it to your needs:
	
	...
	$GLOBALS["config"] = array(
		"mysql" => array(
			"host"   => "<IP of DB server>",
			"user"   => "<DB username>",
			"pass"   => "<DB user password>",
			"dbname" => "<DB name>"
		)
	);
	...

I will not go into detail on how to configure a virtual host on
Apache2. If you want to do this, please consult the documentation for
Apache2.

If everything has been installed correctly, the web application will 
display the following text when you visit the url:

	SRVMON DIRECTOR - SEVER 1.1 P1 with AES support
	Copyright (C) 2015  Pol Warnimont
	The SRVMON DIRECTOR SERVER comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY!

	Waiting for input . . .

Please note that the current agents do not support HTTPS connections.
This will be changes in the next project release (SRVMON R2).
