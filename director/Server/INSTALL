SRVMON DIRECTOR - SERVER - INSTALLATION GUIDE
=============================================

(This guide is used for the Debian package)

* Prerequisites *

Before you begin please perform a system update of your installation to
make sure that you have the newest packages installed:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Please make sure that you have the following packages installed on your 
system:

	Name                  Version         Architecture
	=====================-===============-===============
	apache2               2.4.10-10       amd64
	php5                  5.6.7+dfsg-1    all
	php5-mysql            5.6.7+dfsg-1    amd64

It is also important that the SRVMON database is installed and 
initialized on the system.

* Installation *

Simply copy all the files from the project directory to your webserver
root:

	Ex.: rsync -azP . /var/www/vhost/srvmon/

After the files have been copied to your webroot, you then have to
modify the init.php file according to your database configuration:

	vim <webroot>/inc/init.php

Find the section below and modify it to your needs:
	
	...
	$GLOBALS["config"] = array(
		"mysql" => array(
			"host"   => "<IP of DB server>",
			"user"   => "<DB username>",
			"pass"   => "<DB user password>",
			"dbname" => "<DB name>"
		)
	);
	...

I will not go into detail on how to configure a virtual host on
Apache2. If you want to do this, please consult the documentation for
Apache2.

I everything is installed correctly, the web application will display
the following text when you visit the url:

	Waiting for input . . .

It is advised that you use a HTTPS connection. The README files can
