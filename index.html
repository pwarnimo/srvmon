<h2>
<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>SRVMON is a simple monitoring suite for servers, switches, routers and
every other device which has network access. SRVMON uses a SQL database,
where it stores the hosts which should be checked. A user can define
multiple status checks which can then be applied to a host. A user group
can be notified via E-mail if there is any change in status of a host.</p>

<p>The suite is divided in multiple parts.</p>

<h2>
<a id="database" class="anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Database</h2>

<p>The first and most important part is the database. The database has been
created in MariaDB but should also work with MySQL. It should also be 
possible to use MSSQL. The database also offers multiple stored routines
which can be used to control the data of the database.</p>

<h2>
<a id="director" class="anchor" href="#director" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Director</h2>

<p>The next part is the SRVMON director. The directory also has 2 parts.
The first part is the UPDATER which runs on the database server. The
UPDATER then fetches a list of the available hosts from the database and
checks if the hosts are reachable. The second part of the director is
the SERVER, which is used to receive the XML data from the AGENTS.
The UPDATER is written in Java and the SERVER is written in PHP.</p>

<ul>
<li>A director Shell script is available for testing (director-bash.sh)</li>
<li>An updater written in C is planned (Just because I can :-)).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="agent" class="anchor" href="#agent" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agent</h2>

<p>The next part is the SRVMON agent component. The SRVMON agent is used on
the clients in order to communicate with the database and also used to
execute the check commands on the host. The agent can execute multiple
check commands which can be defined in the database. A service could be
a simple shell script which checks the CPU usage. The agent would then
periodically execute the script and send the output to the DIRECTOR
server using XML data. The agent is written in Java.</p>

<ul>
<li>An agent Shell script is available for testing (agent-bash.sh)</li>
<li>An agent written in C is planned (Just because I can :-)).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="web-ui" class="anchor" href="#web-ui" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web UI</h2>

<p>An other part is the Web UI. The WebUI can be used to view and configure 
the SRVMON suite. The webinterface has been written in PHP5, JQuery/Javascript
and also uses Bootstrap.</p>

<h2>
<a id="desktop-client" class="anchor" href="#desktop-client" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Desktop Client</h2>

<p>The last part is the desktop client, which is essentially the same as
the webinterface only that it is a standalone application. I created the
application only to show you that it is possible to create multiple user
interfaces for this suite because all the main logic happens in the
database.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not yet decided if I use C++ w/ QT or Java...</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h2>

<p>I created this monitoring suite just for fun and I know that there are 
other monitoring solutions available but I wanted to do my own project. 
The goal of this project is to create a completely customizable 
monitoring solution. Please feel free to modify and improve this suite.</p>

<p>I also set to my goal, that I want to get this package into the official
Debian repositories so that everyone can get, work and share this 
project.</p>

<p>For any questions please send a mail to .</p>

<h2>
<a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>
<a id="webserver-requirements" class="anchor" href="#webserver-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Webserver requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Apache 2</li>
<li>MariaDB (or MySQL)</li>
<li>PHP5</li>
<li>PHP-GD</li>
<li>PHP-FPDF</li>
<li>PHP-MCRYPT</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="server-requirements" class="anchor" href="#server-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Server requirements</h3>

<p>As operating system for the webinterface and director, I used Debian 7.8
Wheezy.</p>

<p>The agents should run on every system which supports Java and the SQL
connector for Java. The service scripts that I use are simple shell
scripts.</p>

<p>NOTE: You are not required to use the agent component. It is also 
      possible to write an own agent in a shell script as long as it
      supports a connection to the database. The only thing that the
      agent does, is scheduling the service checks and executing the
      stored procedures in the database.</p>

<p>NOTE: A mobile client for Android devices is planned.</p>
