{"name":"SRVMON Monitoring Suite","tagline":"A simple server monitoring suite.","body":"# SRVMON SERVER MONITORING SUITE\r\n\r\nThis suite is currently under development.\r\nThis is a draft release.\r\nVersion 1.0 expected around May/June 2015.\r\n\r\nCURRENT VERSIONS : \r\n* SRVMON DB = 1.0.1\r\n* SRVMON DIRECTOR = 0.1\r\n* SRVMON AGENT = 0.1\r\n* SRVMON WEBUI = 0.1\r\n* SRVMON DESKTOP = 0.1\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nSRVMON is a simple monitoring suite for servers, switches, routers or\r\nevery other device which has network access. SRVMON uses a SQL database,\r\nwhere it stores the hosts which should be checked. A user can define\r\nmultiple status checks which can then be applied to a host. A user group\r\ncan be notified via mail if there is any change in status of a host.\r\n\r\nThe suite is divided in multiple applications.\r\n\r\n## Database\r\n\r\nThe first an most important part is the database. The database has been \r\ncreated in MySQL but should also work with MariaDB. It should also be \r\npossible to use MSSQL. The database also offers multiple stored \r\nprocedures which can be used to control the data of the database.\r\n\r\n## Director\r\n\r\nThe next part is the SRVMON director. This program is only used to check\r\nif the hosts, which are defined in the database, are reachable. The\r\ndirector disables a host and all its children if the communication\r\nfails. The director is written in C++.\r\n* A director Shell script is available for testing (director-bash.sh)\r\n\r\n## Agent\r\n\r\nThe next part is the SRVMON agent component. The SRVMON agent is used on\r\nthe clients in order to communicate with the database and used to\r\nexecute the check commands on the host. The agent can execute multiple\r\ncheck commands which can be defined in the database. A service could be\r\na simple shell script which checks the CPU usage. The agent would then\r\nperiodically execute the script and send the output to the SQL database.\r\nThe agent is written in C++.\r\n* An agent Shell script is available for testing (agent-bash.sh)\r\n\r\n## Web UI\r\n\r\nOn other part is the webinterface. The webinterface can be used to view\r\nand configure the SRVMON suite. The webinterface has been written in\r\nPHP 5.\r\n\r\n## Desktop Client\r\n\r\nThe last part is the desktop client, which is essentially the same as\r\nthe webinterface only that it is a standalone application. I created the\r\napplication only to show you that it is possible to create multiple user\r\ninterfaces for this suite because all the main logic happens in the\r\ndatabase.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nI created this monitoring suite just for fun and I know that there are \r\nother monitoring solutions available but I wanted to do my own project. \r\nThe goal of this project is to create a completely customizable \r\nmonitoring solution. Please feel free to modify and improve this suite.\r\n\r\nFor any questions please send a mail to <pwarnimo(at)gmail.com>.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### Webserver requirements\r\n * Apache 2\r\n * MariaDB (or MySQL)\r\n * PHP 5\r\n * PHP-GD\r\n * PHP-FPDF\r\n * PHP-MCRYPT\r\n\r\n### Server requirements\r\n \r\nAs operating system for the webinterface and director, I used Debian 7.8\r\nWheezy.\r\n\r\nThe agents should run on every system which supports Java and the SQL\r\nconnector for Java. The service scripts that I use are simple shell\r\nscripts.\r\n\r\nNOTE: You are not required to use the agent component. It is also \r\n      possible to write an own agent in a shell script as long as it\r\n      supports a connection to the database. The only thing that the\r\n      agent does, is scheduling the service checks and executing the\r\n      stored procedures in the database.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
